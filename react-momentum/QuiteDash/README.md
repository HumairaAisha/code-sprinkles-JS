# Sandbox

**Sandbox** is my React playground — a hands-on project designed to help me explore and master React concepts by building a fully functional dashboard step by step.

## Project Overview
- This project is structured to help me learn React in context, rather than through isolated exercises.
- The focus is on building a dashboard experience with real-world patterns like:
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Top bar interactions
  - Cards, tables, and charts
  - Forms and dynamic updates
  - API integration and state management
- Tailwind CSS and Vite are used for styling and project setup.

## Learning Goals
By the end of Sandbox, I aim to:
1. Understand and implement reusable components
2. Master React hooks, state, and props
3. Handle real-time data and API calls
4. Build a fully responsive, functional dashboard

**Why Sandbox:**  
- Encourages experimentation without fear of mistakes  
- Lets me build a functional dashboard while learning  
- Prepares me for real-world React projects
