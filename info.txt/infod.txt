Key Features:

Button Click: Triggers search only on click, unlike autocomplete’s real-time updates.
Filtering: Use Array.find to locate the first matching country (e.g., name.common.toLowerCase().includes(input.toLowerCase())).
Reuse Logic: showCountry reuses showFirstCountry logic for consistency.
Error Handling: Handles empty input or no matches with clear messages.
CSS (Suggested): Style .search-btn for visibility (e.g., padding: 8px; cursor: pointer;).
Learning Filtering:

Filtering here uses a single match (Array.find) for simplicity.
For autocomplete later, you’ll use Array.filter to get multiple matches, building on this logic.
EXTRACT Concept: Extract country.name.common for comparison, similar to extracting error.message in the catch block, ensuring safe access.
nput Event: Captures real-time typing with input event.
Filtering: Uses Array.filter to find all matches (e.g., “to” matches “Togo”, “Tonga”).
Addressing Your Understanding
Choosing autocomplete now is a smart move, as it teaches filtering, which applies to both features.

Why Autocomplete:

Builds real-time interaction using Array.filter.
Reuses showFirstCountry logic.
Prepares for a search button by mastering filtering.
