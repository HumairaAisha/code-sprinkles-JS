# The Alien Friend - JavaScript
## Hi There,

Why ‚ÄúAlien Friend‚Äù?
Because sometimes learning JavaScript feels like talking to an alien üëΩ  
But the more I build, the more I want to turn it into an ally.

This repo will serve as my learning process through small, focused projects. It's a way to:
- Practice real-world problem-solving
- Track my growth

## What I'm Practicing

- DOM Selection (`getElementById`, `querySelector`)
- Event Listeners (`click`, `input`, etc.)
- Conditional Logic
- Loops and Iteration
- Clean Layouts with HTML/CSS
- How to Fetch API(Application Programming Interface)
- Thinking before coding, planning how to solve each challenge
